# Time-spent-during-quarantine---data-visualization
From a survey, a csv file is created and is analysed using data visualization techniques. It is done by creating bar chart and pie chart for good visualization.
This project is about how people are spending their time during this lockdown days. 
I conducted a survey on my Instagram account's story and collected data from it. Then, I entered the data in excel file and stored it as csv file(.csv format). Then, data visualization techniques are used to analyze the data and visualize it by plotting. I did bar graph and pie chart representation of the visualization techniques since they are of better quality in this case of my project.
